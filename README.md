### What I learned

Working with this project made me realize what's the true meaning of learning by working.
While working on this project I learned concepts like :-

-dividing and conquer technique
-Flexbox properties 
-Resposive Design of Website
-Use of google fonts 

### Continued development

During this project I learned a lot about responsive designs and hope to refine that in my upcoming projects.
While working with images properties and adjusting the width and height properties of it for being resposive is one part of skill I really need to work upon.
Not only this I also have to learn other concepts like javascript to complete my Frontend part atleast first.
